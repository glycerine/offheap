When GC pauses are long because you've got big hash tables in Go, you need an off-heap hash-table.


 The purpose here is to have a hash table that can work away
 from Go's Garbage Collector, to avoid long GC pause times.

 We accomplish this by writing our own Malloc() and Free() implementation
 (see malloc.go) which requests memory directly from the OS.
 The keys, the values, and the entire hash table itself is kept
 in this off-heap storage. This storage can also optionally be backed by a memory mapped file for speedy persistence and fast startup times.

Update: the cgo-malloc branch of this github repo has an implementation that uses CGO to
call the malloc/calloc/free functions in the C stdlib. Using CGO
gives up the save-to-disk instantly feature and creates a portability issue where
you have linked against a specific version of the C stdlib. However if you
are making/destroying alot of tables, the CGO apporach may be faster.

 See offheap.go for all the interesting code. Modify val_t to hold
 you values, and key_t to contain your keys. Current sample code
 for three types of keys (int64, []byte, and strings) is provided (see bytekey.go).
 For the hashing function itself, the incredibly fast [xxhash64](https://github.com/OneOfOne/xxhash) is used to produce uint64 hashes of strings and []byte.

 Note that all your key and values should be inline in the Cell. If you
 point back into the go-heap, such values maybe garbage collected by
 the Go runtime without notice.
